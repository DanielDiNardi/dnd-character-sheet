But non the less adventurers are enticed by monetary gain at the hand of wealthy financial backers.\nOnce known by locals these adventurers are given the derogatory term Reaver, that nothing is sacred.\n\nOn this task Rodrick came in contact with the artefact, a grimoire which contained the crystallised memories\nof an elf of long ago. Upon contact these memories were injected into Rodrick destroying the artefact in the progress.\nNot realising the initial effects Rodrick started having faint dreams of the past, not his.\n\nAfter returning to his sponsor and telling of his happenings, he was sent to a great mage college of ${name_here} to be studied,\nfor a way to undo the fate that occurred. It was there where Rodrick found out he could enter trance-like states\nchannelling the memories of the long forgotten elf to bring magic into existence, along with the bladesong \nand unlocking his latent capacity for magic.\n\nBeing indebted to his sponsor, Rodrick nowadays works as a free agent for the mage college of ${name_here}.\nThe injected memories and his own study of the arts have proven to be useful skillset\nin the arsenal of the mage college, whether it be to perform more dungeon delving or other work. \n\nHe now wanders the lands aligned to the mage college free-willed,  waiting for the call to action.",
